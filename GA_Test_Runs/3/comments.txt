All very very stable fitnesses per run and over each run. This is good (I think).
Obvioulsy the exact values and thus the results are off because no dials algorithm was used.
This next run will be low quantity same volume matrix to test the validity of the dials algorithm.
Small scale 3D tests confirmed the results made sense but wanted to try it in the pipeline to be sure before a N=50 run.
