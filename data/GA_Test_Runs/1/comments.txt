Initial run. Going in blind.

Main takeaways:
Diversity constantly decreased per epoch, this means some part of the fitness sharing approach did not work.
Given the conditional for running the diversity function was reached, the only conclusion is the conditional within this diversity function was not reached.
The condition is based on the sigma value also known as the sharing radius or something similar (not sure the exact name).
Currently the value seems to be too small, so I will increase it and keep everything else the same for the next run. 
Ideal behaviour is diversity remain constant or increase for a time until later on it should drop.
From the time it drops there should be a sufficient amount of epochs for convergence to occur and the result to stabalize for a non negligable amount of generations (AKA no noise at the end for fitness vs. epoch)
