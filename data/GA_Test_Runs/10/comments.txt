unfortunately 24 hours later i found a better solution through basic testing manually (took less than 2 minutes to find a line that produces a better soln).
I noticed that taper was not done properly (ie result is not divided by 10 to produce a number between 0 and 1 inclusive). 
Fixing this for next run and adjusting the dimension limits to allow for better exploration.
In particular I have soft remove limits for 'xy' on both shape parent classes while left the z limit (since this is a hard design limit based on system constraints)

further, there is a particular edge case where the ridge may block a part of usable catalyst or void from being accessed by the oxygen layer diffusion path
in this event, do not mark these void spaces as dead. it should be marked as a uint32_max or something along those lines so its counted against the algorithm to discourage dead catalysts.
