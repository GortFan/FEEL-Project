Diversity is now increasing until the threshold no longer allows for it then it decreases.
This is the expected behaviour. Good.
The final fitness value is essentially the same as from Run 1. 
This suggests fitness sharing has no impact on the final result. 
Next step should be to do repeated runs to see if any other final values arise.
I will do a frequence distribution and std deviation for this collection of results.
I will do 50 runs for statistical significance. This will take 12.5 hours.
